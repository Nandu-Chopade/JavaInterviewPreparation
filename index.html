<!-- Abstraction -->
<section>
    <h2>1. Abstraction</h2>
    <p>Hiding internal implementation and sharing a set of services is called abstraction. It can be achieved by using "Interface" and "Abstract Class". Examples: Car, Mobile, etc.</p>
</section>

<!-- Encapsulation -->
<section>
    <h2>2. Encapsulation</h2>
    <p>Wrapping of data member and methods is called Encapsulation. It is achieved by making data members "private". POJO class is a good example of encapsulation. Examples: Engine, Gearbox within Car, etc.</p>
</section>

<!-- Inheritance -->
<section>
    <h2>4. Inheritance</h2>
    <p>Acquiring properties of the Parent class is called inheritance. It is also called IS-A relationship. It helps in the reusability of code. Example: New Car version inherits properties from old versions.</p>
</section>

<!-- Polymorphism -->
<section>
    <h2>5. Polymorphism</h2>
    <p>Polymorphism means one name, many forms. It makes reusability simple and also makes code understanding easy. There are two types of Polymorphism: Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding, Overriding) and Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Binding, Overloading).</p>

</section>

<!-- Static -->
<section>
    <h2>8. Static</h2>
    <p>Static is a keyword. It can be applied to variables, methods, blocks, and classes. It helps in achieving reusability by allowing common properties for all objects.</p>
</section>

<!-- Non-Static Block -->
<section>
    <h2>9. Non-Static Block</h2>
    <p>It is used for non-initializing content. Before calling the constructor, the non-static block is executed.</p>
</section>

<!-- Constructor -->
<section>
    <h2>10. Constructor</h2>
    <p>A constructor in Java is a special method that is called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize objects as well as non-static variables. Constructors can also take parameters to initialize data members.</p>
</section>

<!-- Object -->

<header>
    <h1>Exception Handling</h1>
</header>
    
<section>
    <h2>11. Object</h2>
    <p>An object is an instance of a class. Objects have states and behaviors. Ways to create an object include using the new Operator, newInstance(), Clone(), Factory methods, and Deserialization.</p>
</section>
<!-- Exception Handling -->
<section>
    <h2>12. Exception Handling</h2>
    <p>In our application, there are chances of abnormal conditions where the normal flow of the program gets disturbed; such situations are called exceptions. All types of exceptions only occur at runtime. To avoid abnormal termination, we need to handle exceptions. Exceptions can occur due to wrong user input.</p>
</section>

<!-- What is Exception Handling? -->
<section>
    <h2>13. What is Exception Handling?</h2>
    <p>To avoid occurring exceptions, we need to provide an alternative way to execute the rest of the program; this is called exception handling. Keywords to handle exceptions: try, catch, finally, throw, throws.</p>

<!-- How ArrayList works? -->
<section>
    <h2>5. How ArrayList works?</h2>
    <p>When we create an object of ArrayList, it creates an ArrayList instance with a default capacity of 10. The capacity increases with the formula: New Capacity = ((3/2) x Old Capacity) + 1. ArrayList follows indexing.</p>

<!-- How we synchronize ArrayList? -->
<section>
    <h2>7. How we synchronize ArrayList?</h2>
    <p>By default, ArrayList object is non-synchronized, but we can get a synchronized version of the ArrayList object by using the following method of the Collections Class:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
ArrayList al = new ArrayList();
List l = Collections.synchronizedList(al);
        </code>
    </pre>
</section>

<!-- Explain all Constructors of ArrayList -->
<section>
    <h2>8. Explain all Constructors of ArrayList</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>ArrayList l = new ArrayList();</code> - Creates an Empty ArrayList Object with the Default Initial Capacity 10.</li>
        <li><code>ArrayList l = new ArrayList(int initialCapacity);</code> - Creates an Empty ArrayList Object with a specified Initial Capacity.</li>
        <li><code>ArrayList l = new ArrayList(Collection c);</code> - Creates an equivalent ArrayList Object for the given Collection Object.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- Why set doesn’t allow duplicates? -->
<section>
    <h2>9. Why set doesn’t allow duplicates?</h2>
    <p>Set internally uses HashMap, and HashMap does not accept duplicate keys. As a result, set doesn’t allow duplicate values.</p>
</section>

<!-- How add() of set works? -->
<section>
    <h2>10. How add() of set works?</h2>
    <p>The <code>add()</code> method of Set returns a boolean value (true or false). It uses the <code>equals()</code> method of the object class and implements HashMap internally.</p>
</section>

<!-- How LinkedList works? -->
<section>
    <h2>11. How LinkedList works? (Why insertion & deletion is fast in LinkedList?)</h2>
    <p>When we create an object of LinkedList and add an element to it, it stores the element as a node in which the previous & next node address is also stored. This doubly linked list structure makes insertion and deletion operations fast as data shift operations are not needed.</p>
</section>

<!-- Define LinkedList -->
<section>
    <h2>12. Define LinkedList?</h2>
    <p>LinkedList is one of the implemented classes of the List interface in the collection framework. It allows duplicate values, preserves insertion order, and maintains indexing. It follows a doubly linked list structure and is mostly preferable for insertion and deletion operations.</p>
</section>

<!-- What is Map? -->
<section>
    <h2>13. What is Map?</h2>
    <p>Map is used to store different objects in the pair of "key" and "value". In a map, the key should be unique, and insertion order will not be maintained.</p>

</section>

<!-- How HashMap works? -->
<section>
    <h2>15. How HashMap works?</h2>
    <p>When we create a HashMap object, it creates a HashMap instance with a default capacity of 16 buckets. During the add (put()) operation, it internally uses hashing to generate hashcodes for keys and calculates the index to find the bucket location for inserting data. It stores the elements in node format.</p>
</section>

<!-- What is Hash Collision? -->
<section>
    <h2>16. What is Hash Collision?</h2>
    <p>In HashMap, if two keys have the same hashcodes, it is called hash collision. In such a case, a doubly linked list is created to insert data, and retrieval is performed using the equals() method.</p>
</section>

<!-- What happens when we put the same keys in Map? -->
<section>
    <h2>17. What happens when we put the same keys in Map?</h2>
    <p>If we add a key-value pair where the key already exists, the put method replaces the existing value of the key with the new value.</p>
</section>

<!-- Contract between equals() & hashcode() -->
<section>
    <h2>18. Contract between equals() & hashcode()</h2>
    <p>If equals() returns true, then objects must have the same hashcodes. If equals() returns false, then objects may or may not have the same hashcodes. If hashcodes of objects are the same, then we can’t conclude the output of equals(), it may be true or false. If hashcodes of objects are different, then the output of equals() must be false.</p>

    <p><strong>Fail-Fast Iterators Internal Working:</strong></p>

        <li>Every fail-fast collection has a modCount field, representing how many times the collection has changed/modified.</li>
        <li>At every modification of this collection, the modCount value is incremented (e.g., when elements are added or removed).</li>
        <li>The iterator stores the modCount value during initialization, and if there is any change in the collection structure while iterating, an exception is thrown.</li>

Garbage collector dominates WeakHashMap. Both null values and null keys are supported in WeakHashMap, and it is not synchronized.</p>

<!-- Hibernate and ORM -->
<section>
    <h2>1. What is Hibernate & ORM tool?</h2>
    <p><strong>(Hibernate)</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is a Java framework that simplifies the development of Java applications to interact with the database.</li>
        <li>Creates SQL queries at runtime according to the database.</li>
        <li>Provides automatic table creation feature, relationship mapping (IS-A and HAS-A), and primary key auto-increment.</li>
        <li>Converts checked exceptions into unchecked exceptions.</li>
        <li>Provides cache mechanism and supports HQL (Hibernate Query Language) queries and Criteria API.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>(ORM)</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming technique that maps objects to data stored in the database.</li>
        <li>Overcomes the mismatch between OOP languages & databases, reducing developer efforts, time, and cost.</li>
    </ul>

<!-- States of an object -->
<section>
    <h2>6. What are the states of an object? Explain them.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Transient state:</strong> Initial state of an object, not associated with the Session, modifications don't affect the database.</li>
        <li><strong>Persistent state:</strong> Object associated with the Session, each object represents a row in the database table.</li>
        <li><strong>Detached state:</strong> Object is no longer associated with the Session, modifications don't affect the database, but it still has a representation in the database.</li>

    <h2>7. What is Hibernate transaction management?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Methods like update & delete need transaction boundaries.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Cache stores data to reduce the number of database queries.</li>
        <li>1st level cache is associated with the session and is always enabled.</li>
        <li>When a query is fired, data is stored in the local session. Subsequent queries for the same data within the session use the local session rather than hitting the database again.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- 2nd level cache -->
<section>
    <h2>9. What is 2nd level cache?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Associated with the session factory and needs to be enabled.</li>
        <li>Available globally for all sessions, stores data from the database to 1st level cache and then to 2nd level cache.</li>
        <li>If data is not found in the 1st level cache, it checks the 2nd level cache before firing a query to the database.</li>
