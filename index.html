<!-- Abstraction -->
<section>
    <h2>1. Abstraction</h2>
    <p>Hiding internal implementation and sharing a set of services is called abstraction. It can be achieved by using "Interface" and "Abstract Class". Examples: Car, Mobile, etc.</p>
</section>

<!-- Encapsulation -->
<section>
    <h2>2. Encapsulation</h2>
    <p>Wrapping of data member and methods is called Encapsulation. It is achieved by making data members "private". POJO class is a good example of encapsulation. Examples: Engine, Gearbox within Car, etc.</p>
</section>

<!-- Inheritance -->
<section>
    <h2>4. Inheritance</h2>
    <p>Acquiring properties of the Parent class is called inheritance. It is also called IS-A relationship. It helps in the reusability of code. Example: New Car version inherits properties from old versions.</p>
</section>

<!-- Polymorphism -->
<section>
    <h2>5. Polymorphism</h2>
    <p>Polymorphism means one name, many forms. It makes reusability simple and also makes code understanding easy. There are two types of Polymorphism: Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding, Overriding) and Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Binding, Overloading).</p>

</section>

<!-- Static -->
<section>
    <h2>8. Static</h2>
    <p>Static is a keyword. It can be applied to variables, methods, blocks, and classes. It helps in achieving reusability by allowing common properties for all objects.</p>
</section>

<!-- Non-Static Block -->
<section>
    <h2>9. Non-Static Block</h2>
    <p>It is used for non-initializing content. Before calling the constructor, the non-static block is executed.</p>
</section>

<!-- Constructor -->
<section>
    <h2>10. Constructor</h2>
    <p>A constructor in Java is a special method that is called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize objects as well as non-static variables. Constructors can also take parameters to initialize data members.</p>
</section>

<!-- Object -->

<header>
    <h1>Exception Handling</h1>
</header>
    
<section>
    <h2>11. Object</h2>
    <p>An object is an instance of a class. Objects have states and behaviors. Ways to create an object include using the new Operator, newInstance(), Clone(), Factory methods, and Deserialization.</p>
</section>
<!-- Exception Handling -->
<section>
    <h2>12. Exception Handling</h2>
    <p>In our application, there are chances of abnormal conditions where the normal flow of the program gets disturbed; such situations are called exceptions. All types of exceptions only occur at runtime. To avoid abnormal termination, we need to handle exceptions. Exceptions can occur due to wrong user input.</p>
</section>

<!-- What is Exception Handling? -->
<section>
    <h2>13. What is Exception Handling?</h2>
    <p>To avoid occurring exceptions, we need to provide an alternative way to execute the rest of the program; this is called exception handling. Keywords to handle exceptions: try, catch, finally, throw, throws.</p>

<!-- How ArrayList works? -->
<section>
    <h2>5. How ArrayList works?</h2>
    <p>When we create an object of ArrayList, it creates an ArrayList instance with a default capacity of 10. The capacity increases with the formula: New Capacity = ((3/2) x Old Capacity) + 1. ArrayList follows indexing.</p>

<!-- How we synchronize ArrayList? -->
<section>
    <h2>7. How we synchronize ArrayList?</h2>
    <p>By default, ArrayList object is non-synchronized, but we can get a synchronized version of the ArrayList object by using the following method of the Collections Class:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
ArrayList al = new ArrayList();
List l = Collections.synchronizedList(al);
        </code>
    </pre>
</section>

<!-- Explain all Constructors of ArrayList -->
<section>
    <h2>8. Explain all Constructors of ArrayList</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>ArrayList l = new ArrayList();</code> - Creates an Empty ArrayList Object with the Default Initial Capacity 10.</li>
        <li><code>ArrayList l = new ArrayList(int initialCapacity);</code> - Creates an Empty ArrayList Object with a specified Initial Capacity.</li>
        <li><code>ArrayList l = new ArrayList(Collection c);</code> - Creates an equivalent ArrayList Object for the given Collection Object.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- Why set doesn’t allow duplicates? -->
<section>
    <h2>9. Why set doesn’t allow duplicates?</h2>
    <p>Set internally uses HashMap, and HashMap does not accept duplicate keys. As a result, set doesn’t allow duplicate values.</p>
</section>

<!-- How add() of set works? -->
<section>
    <h2>10. How add() of set works?</h2>
    <p>The <code>add()</code> method of Set returns a boolean value (true or false). It uses the <code>equals()</code> method of the object class and implements HashMap internally.</p>
</section>

<!-- How LinkedList works? -->
<section>
    <h2>11. How LinkedList works? (Why insertion & deletion is fast in LinkedList?)</h2>
    <p>When we create an object of LinkedList and add an element to it, it stores the element as a node in which the previous & next node address is also stored. This doubly linked list structure makes insertion and deletion operations fast as data shift operations are not needed.</p>
</section>

<!-- Define LinkedList -->
<section>
    <h2>12. Define LinkedList?</h2>
    <p>LinkedList is one of the implemented classes of the List interface in the collection framework. It allows duplicate values, preserves insertion order, and maintains indexing. It follows a doubly linked list structure and is mostly preferable for insertion and deletion operations.</p>
</section>

<!-- What is Map? -->
<section>
    <h2>13. What is Map?</h2>
    <p>Map is used to store different objects in the pair of "key" and "value". In a map, the key should be unique, and insertion order will not be maintained.</p>

</section>

<!-- How HashMap works? -->
<section>
    <h2>15. How HashMap works?</h2>
    <p>When we create a HashMap object, it creates a HashMap instance with a default capacity of 16 buckets. During the add (put()) operation, it internally uses hashing to generate hashcodes for keys and calculates the index to find the bucket location for inserting data. It stores the elements in node format.</p>
</section>

<!-- What is Hash Collision? -->
<section>
    <h2>16. What is Hash Collision?</h2>
    <p>In HashMap, if two keys have the same hashcodes, it is called hash collision. In such a case, a doubly linked list is created to insert data, and retrieval is performed using the equals() method.</p>
</section>

<!-- What happens when we put the same keys in Map? -->
<section>
    <h2>17. What happens when we put the same keys in Map?</h2>
    <p>If we add a key-value pair where the key already exists, the put method replaces the existing value of the key with the new value.</p>
</section>

<!-- Contract between equals() & hashcode() -->
<section>
    <h2>18. Contract between equals() & hashcode()</h2>
    <p>If equals() returns true, then objects must have the same hashcodes. If equals() returns false, then objects may or may not have the same hashcodes. If hashcodes of objects are the same, then we can’t conclude the output of equals(), it may be true or false. If hashcodes of objects are different, then the output of equals() must be false.</p>

    <p><strong>Fail-Fast Iterators Internal Working:</strong></p>

        <li>Every fail-fast collection has a modCount field, representing how many times the collection has changed/modified.</li>
        <li>At every modification of this collection, the modCount value is incremented (e.g., when elements are added or removed).</li>
        <li>The iterator stores the modCount value during initialization, and if there is any change in the collection structure while iterating, an exception is thrown.</li>

    <h2>Design Pattern</h2>

    <!-- Explain with example Singleton Class Design Pattern -->
    <h3>1. Explain with example Singleton Class Design Pattern?</h3>
    <p>
        Creating multiple objects for a Java class with the same data is a wastage of memory. So, we can use a Singleton Java class, which allows creating only one object per Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This minimizes memory wastage and improves performance. Singleton classes are useful when having only one instance is crucial.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
    <code>
class Demo {
    private static Demo instance;
    
    private Demo() {
        System.out.println("Demo: 0-arg Con");
    }

    // Static factory method
    public static Demo getInstance() {
        // Singleton Logic
        if (instance == null) instance = new Demo();
        return instance;
    }

    // Override Object class clone()
    public Object clone() {
        return instance;
    }
}
    </code>
    </pre>

    <!-- How to break Singleton Class? -->
    <h3>2. How to break Singleton Class?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Using Reflection:</li>
        <pre>
        <code>
import java.lang.reflect.Constructor;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Demo s = Demo.getInstance();
        Class clazz = Demo.class;
        Constructor cons = clazz.getDeclaredConstructor();
        cons.setAccessible(true);
        Demo s2 = (Demo) cons.newInstance();
    }
}
        </code>
        </pre>
        <li>The singleton will only work per classLoader. To break it, use multiple classLoaders.</li>
        <li>Serialize the object, store it in a file, and deserialize it to get a new object.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- What is Class Loader? -->
    <h3>3. What is Class Loader?</h3>
    <p>
        The Java ClassLoader is a part of the Java Runtime Environment responsible for dynamically loading Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine. It allows classes to be loaded into memory when required by an application, and these classes are loaded dynamically to facilitate flexibility in loading classes at runtime.
    </p>

    <!-- What is a real-time example of Singleton Class Design Pattern? -->
    <h3>4. What is a real-time example of Singleton Class Design Pattern?</h3>
    <p>
        A real-time example of a Singleton Class is a Music Player Software. The class contains services like Play the song, Stop the Song, Change the song, etc. Having a single instance of this class ensures that the same player instance is used for playing multiple songs in the application.

    <h2>Serialization</h2>

    <!-- What is Serialization? -->
    <h3>1. What is Serialization?</h3>
    <p>
        Serialization is the process of saving or writing the state of an object to a file. It involves converting an object from its Java-supported form to a network or file-supported form. The serialization process can be achieved using the FileOutputStream and ObjectOutputStream classes.
    </p>

    <!-- Have you used Serialization in your project? -->
    <h3>2. Have you used Serialization in your project?</h3>
    <p>
        (Answer based on personal experience)
    </p>

    <!-- What is a real-time technical example of Serialization? -->
    <h3>3. What is a real-time technical example of Serialization?</h3>
    <p>
        In applications like Flipkart or Amazon, images of products in the buying section are often stored in binary format in databases using serialization. When clients download these images from the website, the images are deserialized into the client's device.
    </p>

    <!-- How to serialize particular states of objects of class? -->
    <h3>4. How to serialize particular states of objects of class?</h3>
    <p>
        Serialization of specific states of objects can be achieved by using the externalization process. To provide externalizable ability for any object, the corresponding class should implement the Externalizable interface, which is a child interface of the Serializable interface.

    <!-- What is Retrospective Call? -->
    <h3>8. What is Retrospective Call?</h3>
    <p>
        A Retrospective Call takes place at the end of a Sprint. It involves discussing issues encountered during the sprint and ensuring they are not repeated in the next sprint. Kudos and thanksgiving are also part of this session.
    </p>

    <!-- What is Demo Call? -->
    <h3>9. What is Demo Call?</h3>
    <p>
        A Demo Call is held at the end of a sprint and involves demonstrating completed stories to the client. Client suggestions are then incorporated into the next sprint's stories by the Product Owner.
    </p>

    <!-- How did you gather requirements from Client? -->
    <h3>10. How did you gather requirements from the Client?</h3>
    <p>
        Requirements are typically gathered by a Product Owner who interacts with the client. The gathered requirements are then converted into stories and assigned to developers.
    </p>

    <!-- How did Stories assign to you? -->
    <h3>11. How did Stories assign to you?</h3>
    <p>
        Stories are usually received via emails from the Product Owner, with stories attached in document format. In larger companies, tools like JIRA are often used for handling the entire Agile process.

    <!-- What is String Constant Pool (SCP) concept? -->
    <h3>1. What is String Constant Pool (SCP) concept?</h3>
    <p>
        The String Constant Pool (SCP) is an area where String objects are created without using the <code>new</code> operator. Objects created in SCP are checked against previous objects before creation. If an object with the same content already exists, the reference variable points to the existing object. SCP does not allow duplicate objects.
    </p>

    <!-- When does an object get created in SCP? -->
    <h3>2. When does an object get created in SCP?</h3>
    <p>
        Objects get created in SCP when a String object is created without using the <code>new</code> keyword or when only a String variable with content is created.
    </p>

    <!-- Why String is immutable? -->
    <h3>3. Why is String immutable?</h3>

        <li>The instance variable of the class is <code>final</code>, i.e., we cannot change the value of it after creating an object.</li>
        <li>The class is <code>final</code>, so we cannot create a subclass.</li>
        <li>There are no setter methods, i.e., we have no option to change the value of the instance variable.</li>
